Since I am planning to buy a car, I would like you to furnish me with more information regarding your newest models of car, their costs and other features.

I’m interested in purchasing a new car by the end of next week. I’m shopping around for the best price on a 2016 Toyota Corolla with the body protection package 1. I would like either classic silver or slate metallic for the color. Please provide a price with a breakdown of all fees. I also would like to be informed of any rebates or incentives that are available.

I am preapproved for financing but open to financing through the dealership if you can provide a better rate.
